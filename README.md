# Web Scraping from an E-Commerce site.

Web scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an automated fashion. Itâ€™s also called web data extraction. 

Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. 




## Steps

- Identify the target website.
- Collect URLs of the pages which you want to extract data from.
- Make a request to these URLs to get the HTML of the page.
- Use locators to find the data in the HTML.
- Save the data in a JSON or CSV file or some other structured format.



## Libraries Used

### BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is another Python library that is highly suitable for Web Scraping. It creates a parse tree that can be used to extract data from HTML on a website. Beautiful soup also has multiple features for navigation, searching, and modifying these parse trees.



## Usage

Some of the main uses cases of web scraping include price monitoring, news monitoring, lead generation, and market research among many others.
